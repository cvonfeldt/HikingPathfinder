Developed a pathfinding application to compute optimal paths for a hiker according to user-inputted elevation data using dynamic algorithm approach. Implemented recursive approach to reduce average pathfinding times by a factor of 7.5x. 
Designed a versatile user interface to handle input map files then generate visual output for hikers to follow on their path.


Challenges: I encountered much less challenges in part 2 compared to part 1 - likely because I already had the bulk content of the project completed. That being said, my biggest issue was populating my cost vector with the correct values. It turned out to be an easy fix (taking the " + elevationTotalCost" out of the absolute value). All it took was some deep analysis and inspection of my code to find the silly mistake.
