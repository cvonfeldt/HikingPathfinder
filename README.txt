Challenges: I encountered much less challenges in part 2 compared to part 1 - likely because I already had the bulk content of the project completed. That being said, my biggest issue was populating my cost vector with the correct values. It turned out to be an easy fix (taking the " + elevationTotalCost" out of the absolute value). All it took was some deep analysis and inspection of my code to find the silly mistake.
